Pricing your course depends on several factors, including your target audience, the value provided, market competition, and delivery format (self-paced vs. live sessions). Here’s a suggested pricing strategy based on these factors:

---

### **Key Factors to Consider:**

1. **Target Audience:**
   - Non-tech-savvy business owners and professionals are often willing to invest in practical, hands-on courses that directly benefit their business operations.
   - They expect affordability but also value if the course solves real problems.

2. **Course Format:**
   - **Live Sessions:** Include real-time interaction, personalized feedback, and Q&A. These courses can be priced higher due to the added value.
   - **Self-Paced Learning:** Lower cost since it requires less direct instructor involvement but still provides substantial value.

3. **Duration and Content:**
   - A comprehensive 8-week course covering essential tools and hands-on exercises is worth more than shorter or less comprehensive offerings.

4. **Market Research:**
   - Similar courses often charge:
     - $200–$500 for self-paced courses.
     - $500–$1,500 for live instructor-led programs.
     - Higher-end options (e.g., certifications) may exceed $2,000.
