### **Lecture Outline**

#### **1. Introduction to Cybersecurity Basics**
   - **Why Cybersecurity Matters:**
     - Growing risks: phishing, ransomware, and data breaches.
     - Impacts on small businesses: financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.
   - **Common Threats:**
     - Weak passwords, phishing emails, outdated software, and insufficient backups.
   - **Key Principles of Cybersecurity:**
     - **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is only accessible to authorized individuals.
     - **Integrity:** Ensuring data is accurate and tamper-free.
     - **Availability:** Ensuring data is accessible when needed.

---

#### **2. Securing Business Data**

   - **Data Encryption:**
     - Encrypt sensitive files before sharing or storing them (e.g., Google Workspace encryption).
     - Use HTTPS for secure website browsing and data transfers.

   - **Restrict Access:**
     - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit who can access specific systems or data.

   - **Regular Updates:**
     - Keep all devices, software, and systems updated to reduce vulnerabilities.

---

#### **3. Safe Online Practices**

   - **Avoid Phishing Attacks:**
     - Learn to identify suspicious emails (e.g., misspellings, unverified senders).
     - Avoid clicking on unknown links or downloading untrusted attachments.

   - **Secure Wi-Fi Usage:**
     - Use strong passwords for Wi-Fi networks.
     - Avoid accessing sensitive information on public Wi-Fi; use a VPN if necessary.

   - **Browser Security:**
     - Use browser extensions that block malicious websites (e.g., HTTPS Everywhere, uBlock Origin).

---

#### **4. Managing Passwords**

   - **Why Passwords Matter:**
     - Weak passwords are a leading cause of breaches.
     - Use unique, strong passwords for every account.

   - **Tools: LastPass for Password Management**
     - Automatically generate, store, and autofill strong passwords.
     - Features: Secure password sharing, multi-device syncing, and encrypted storage.

---

#### **5. Managing Backups**

   - **Why Backups Are Essential:**
     - Protects against data loss due to hardware failure, ransomware, or accidental deletion.

   - **Backup Tools:**
     - **CrashPlan:** Easy-to-use backup tool for local and cloud storage.
     - **Google Drive:** Simple solution for storing critical business documents securely.

   - **Backup Best Practices:**
     - Use the 3-2-1 rule: Keep three copies of your data, store two locally on different devices, and one offsite (cloud-based).

### **Hands-On Exercises**

#### **Exercise 1: Set Up a Secure Password Manager in LastPass**
1. **Objective:** Learn to securely manage passwords using LastPass.
2. **Steps:**
   - Sign up for a LastPass account at [lastpass.com](https://www.lastpass.com).
   - Install the browser extension or mobile app.
   - Create a strong master password (e.g., 16+ characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
   - Add at least three key business accounts to the vault (e.g., email, bank, CRM).
   - Test autofill functionality for a saved account.
3. **Outcome:** Participants will have a centralized, secure vault for managing passwords.

#### **Exercise 2: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for a Business Email Account**
1. **Objective:** Enhance email security by adding an additional layer of protection.
2. **Steps:**
   - Log in to your business email account (e.g., Google Workspace, Outlook).
   - Navigate to the security settings and locate the "Two-Step Verification" or "2FA" option.
   - Choose a method (e.g., SMS code, authentication app like Google Authenticator, or hardware key).
   - Follow the prompts to set up 2FA.
   - Test the login process to ensure 2FA is functioning correctly.
3. **Outcome:** Email accounts will be protected against unauthorized access.

#### **Exercise 3: Create a Backup Plan Using Google Drive**
1. **Objective:** Secure critical business data using cloud storage.
2. **Steps:**
   - Log in to Google Drive or create an account if needed.
   - Identify key business documents to back up (e.g., contracts, financial records, customer data).
   - Upload these files to a secure folder in Google Drive.
   - Set up regular backups for these files (e.g., using Google Backup and Sync or manually scheduling uploads).
   - Test downloading a file to ensure it is accessible.
3. **Outcome:** Participants will have a basic backup plan to protect essential business documents.
