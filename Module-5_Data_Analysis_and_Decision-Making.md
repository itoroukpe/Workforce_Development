### **Lecture Outline**

#### **1. Basics of Data Visualization and Analysis**
   - **What is Data Analysis?**
     - The process of inspecting, cleaning, and modeling data to discover useful information for decision-making.
     - Example: Identifying trends in sales data to plan inventory.

   - **Why is Visualization Important?**
     - Helps simplify complex datasets.
     - Allows quick identification of trends, outliers, and patterns.
     - Example: A bar chart showing sales performance across regions.

   - **Common Visualization Types:**
     - **Bar Charts:** Compare quantities across categories (e.g., sales by product).
     - **Line Charts:** Show trends over time (e.g., revenue growth).
     - **Pie Charts:** Display proportions (e.g., market share by product line).
     - **Heatmaps:** Highlight high and low values in datasets.

   **Interactive Question:** Ask participants to name a business scenario where they think data visualization could help.

#### **2. Understanding Key Business Metrics**
   - **Definition of Business Metrics:**
     - Quantifiable data points that help evaluate the performance of specific business areas.

   - **Key Metrics for Small Businesses:**
     - **Revenue:** Total income generated.
     - **Profit Margin:** The percentage of revenue that turns into profit.
     - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Cost of acquiring a new customer.
     - **Customer Retention Rate:** Percentage of customers retained over time.
     - **Inventory Turnover Rate:** How often inventory is sold and replaced.

   - **How Metrics Guide Decision-Making:**
     - Example: Low inventory turnover may indicate overstocking or poor sales performance.

   **Activity:** Discuss with participants which metrics are most relevant to their businesses.

#### **3. Using Dashboards for Informed Decision-Making**
   - **What is a Dashboard?**
     - A visual display of key metrics and data points to monitor business performance.
     - Example: A dashboard showing daily sales, top-selling products, and revenue trends.

   - **Benefits of Dashboards:**
     - Provide real-time insights for quick decision-making.
     - Centralize data from various sources.
     - Enhance data-driven planning and forecasting.

   - **Dashboard Best Practices:**
     - Focus on relevant metrics (avoid clutter).
     - Use consistent visuals for easy interpretation.
     - Update dashboards regularly to reflect current data.
